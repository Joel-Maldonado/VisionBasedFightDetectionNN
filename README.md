# Vision-Based Fight Detection for Surveillance Cameras

A deep learning model built using TensorFlow for detecting violent scenes in surveillance camera footage. The model analyzes video input and provides:

- A violence rating as a percentage
- A bounding box highlighting the presumed fight and involved individuals

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [RWF-2000 dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05913v3) for training.

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of the **Programming for Social Good** internship at Saturday Academy, which aims to leverage technology for positive social impact. By creating a model that swiftly detects violent scenes in surveillance footage, this project has the potential to enhance public safety and improve law enforcement response times to incidents.

## Presentation

This project was presented at the ASE Saturday Academy Symposium 2022. You can watch the presentation on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD-oEW791a0&t=4523s).
